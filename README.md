# My Advent of Code

It's that time of year for the Advent of Code to start again! This is my first year in participation-- and I'll be working on it with [@pupcus](https://github.com/pupcus) so join the ride with us as we work on the Advent of Code together.

If you'd like to work on it as well, be sure to head over to https://adventofcode.com

As I've found out with @pupcus, it seems that everyone's input is different. So, as a result, I thought I'd share every day (and what I see) as well as the input on a separate branch called "vision". This will hopefully make this make more sense.
