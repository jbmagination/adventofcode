# My Advent of Code

It's that time of year for the Advent of Code to start again! This is my first year in participation-- and I'll be working on it with [@pupcus](https://github.com/pupcus) so join the ride with us as we work on the Advent of Code together.

If you'd like to work on it as well, be sure to head over to https://adventofcode.com

As I discovered with @pupcus, inputs are different across users of AoC. As such, I've made a separate branch called "vision" which you can check out-- wait a minute... you're already here!

---

I've created a private leaderboard for people to compete with us. Use the code `472595-c912363c` if you'd like to join.

*Also, if it's not obvious, the name that we are under is `jbmagination`.*
